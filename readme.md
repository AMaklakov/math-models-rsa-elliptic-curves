You would better have `yarn` installed.

On mac you can open terminal and use command

```bash
brew install yarn
```

## How to run application ?

Open `main.ts` file and change arguments of each function to data of your task. Please change only **numbers**. Don't delete `toBig` wrappers around them

```bash
yarn start
